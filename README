Bot-BasicBot-Pluggable-Module-NorskEngelsk version 0.02
=======================================================

DESCRIPTION

An IRC bot plugin that listens to all is said in a channel,
and when it hears someone speak Norwegian, tries to translate
that to English, using the Google Translate webservice.

It's been very useful for me. I hope it will be for you as well.
